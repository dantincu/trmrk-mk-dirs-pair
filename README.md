# trmrk-mk-dirs-pair
This is where the code for most basic decent form of "make dirs pair" type of console app sits. I intend to use this app for my note taking activities when other (more complete) "make dir pairs" apps somehow don't work (if or when I deploy binaries with undetected blocking bugs).
