# trmrk-mk-dirs-pair
This is where the code for most basic decent form of "make dirs pair" type of console app sits. I intend to use this app for my note taking activities when other (more complete) "make dir pairs" apps somehow don't work (if or when I deploy binaries with undetected blocking bugs).

The code for "more complete" cmd apps that I'm refering to sits in the *turmerik* repo and they are Turmerik.MkFsDirPairs.ConsoleApp, Turmerik.FsNotes.ConsoleApp and, of course, the future GUI apps that I intend to develop as part of the *turmerik* repo.
